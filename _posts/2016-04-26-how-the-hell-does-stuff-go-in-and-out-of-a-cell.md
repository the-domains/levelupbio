How the hell does stuff go in and out of a cell?

Cells allows stuff to go in and out because if they didn't they would die. They need stuff like sugar to go in for energy and they also need to let stuff out or they will explode.

The cell membrane is the thing that surrounds the cell to let stuff go in and out. Remember that every cell has one.

The Cell Membrane is made out of two layers of lipids. Lipids are fats.

Water can pass in and out of a cell. This is called Osmosis.

Look at the diagram above. Water likes to travel where theres more dissolved stuff such as salt. So in the first box the cell is in pure water, since there is more salt in the cell, the water flows inside. 

Look at the third box. This cell is in a really salty solution so the water from his body goes outside.

Look at box in the middle, water goes in and out of the cell equally because there is an equal amount of salt inside and outside of the cell.

This movement of water, called Osmosis, is a type of Diffusion which requires no energy at all. It is called Passive Transport.

The opposite of passive is active. So Active Transport in a process of moving stuff that requires energy. It is like trying to paddle upstream a river instead of just going with the flow. We call this going against a Concentration Gradient.
