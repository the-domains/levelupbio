What the hell is a cell?

Cells make up all living things. All living things are made out of stuff which are made out of cells. Your skin, heart, brain, muscles, kidneys, they are ALL made up of cells.

Some living things are just made up of one cell, think of a bacteria's "body", he's all made up of just one cell. Thats why we call em Unicellular.

Some living things like you are made up of billions of cells, so we call that Multicellular.

Some scientist dudes a long time ago discovered cells when they put living stuff under a microscope and they were like "holy smokes all living things are made out of these!" Then they later figured out that cells can only come from other cells. Cells have this ability to clone themselves. How else do you think you grow from a baby, your body's has to make more of em.

As you can see in this diagram cells have lots of little mini organs inside them called Organelles. All the organelles do jobs for the cell. The nucleus, the big thing in the center, holds the cells DNA. 

There are two main cell types.

Eukaryotes have a nucleus

Prokaryotes DO NOT have a nucleus

The Cell Membrane which every cell in the world has is the thing that surrounds the cell allows stuff to come in and out of it. All the other organelles also do important stuff to keep the cell alive.

Imagine if a cell was Tony Stark and had an Iron Man suit. Plants have an additional layer that surrounds it called the Cell Wall. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d01139cb-b826-4931-ba7e-5f2ec2765e40.png)
